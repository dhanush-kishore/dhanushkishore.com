    <h1>Hey there!</h1>
<p>I am a Senior Data Scientist at Skyscanner, where I built our in-house Bayesian AB experimentation library, 
    <a href="https://medium.com/@SkyscannerEng/wise-skyscanners-bayesian-ab-experimentation-library-and-decision-engine-6841d1643482">WISE</a>. 
    Currently, I am developing ML models to rank flight search results. I have over a decade of experience in data science, analytics, 
    ML model development and AB experimentation. I am extremely technical, and enjoy deep diving into the math behind each algorithm I use. 
    Python is my go-to language, and I am constantly looking to grow my technical skills.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I love going on long walks - London is an amazing city if you enjoy walking, with loads of parks around every corner. 
    I am also a bit of a productivity nerd, and have gone down various rabbit holes of note taking and task management systems and apps. 
    At present, I am trying to learn Tennis, and also have been trying to pick up Spanish.</p>

<p>I prefer staying away from social media, but I do check my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhanushkishore/">LinkedIn</a> 
    regularly - feel free to reach out to me there if you would like to :)</p>
